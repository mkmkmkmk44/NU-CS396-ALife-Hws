# Class to generate a quadruped model using Mujoco
# The creature includes a torso and four legs with hip and ankle joints
# The model creates a simple ant with random ranges of motion with a torso and four legs
# Then generates randomly sized creatures using the structure of the model with random ranges of motion
# The model randomly adjusts the size of the torso, the lengths of the legs, the thickness of the legs, and the strength of the actuators within a certain range
# All classes and functions take values as well (to test the function with different values)
# No values are provided to create random creatures
